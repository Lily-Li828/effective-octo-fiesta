Discussion of our database design:
User stories and their corresponding implementations:

Description of our dataset selected:
We mainly integrated this dataset to provide geological information about natural disaster events on a global scale to give further insights for
scientists from different fields, governments, socially-conscious citizens, etc. Our dataset mainly focuses on three natural disasters that 
happened around the world: earthquake, volcano eruption, and tsunami. For each event, we are able to provide the following information: 
(1) Date (detailed to an hour); 
(2) Country; 
(3) Longitude and Latitude; 
(4) Number of people affected
(5) Different measurements of intensity for each type of natural disaster.
Besides that, we also have the dataset that describes people affected or made homeless by all of the natural disasters annually in every country 
for reference. We also keep the dataset that recorded the annual PM2.5 index for each country.

User stories
STORY: As an environmental scientist, I can retrieve the natural disaster events within a specific geographical region, so that I can analyze 
the pattern of natural disasters throughout a specific year range.
IMPLEMENTATION: We can have input boxes for the users to set a specific year range and output all the relevant disasters sorted by magnitude 
index and year to see if there is a correlation between time and the intensity of disasters. 

STORY: In order to study the correlation between natural disasters and air pollution as an atmospheric chemist, I can output the relevant air 
quality data around a specific disaster and conduct statistical analysis.
IMPLEMENTATION: We can use input boxes to locate one specific disaster event in this case and output the air quality data around that period 
in a graph representing the trend of PM2.5 concentration.

STORY: As a citizen of a country that tsunamis usually occur, I wonder the number of times such natural disasters happen in history and whether
the number of cases increases or decreases for the past 50 years.
IMPLEMENTATION: We could add up all the tsunami cases that happen each year in each country and make a line chart for this country with the year
in the x-axis. We can also inform the user about the countries with most frequently happening tsunamis, and maybe enable comparison of maximum 
water height (meter) or frequency between two or more countries.

STORY: As a citizen of a country where tsunamis usually occur, I wonder how tsunamis affects my country in comparison to all other natural disasters.
IMPLEMENTATION: We could calculate the ratio of people affected by tsunami, volcano eruption and earthquake against the total number of people 
affected by natural disasters and then make a pie chart.

STORY: As an environmental protection skeptic, I can compare air quality data with volcanic activities in different regions, so that I can figure
out whether air quality is related to volcanic eruptions.
IMPLEMENTATION: We could create a line chart with two distinct colors, each indicating volcanic eruption numbers and air quality trends in the 
region of the usersâ€™ choice (aggregate data will also be available).

STORY: As a geologist, I can find the disaster occurrence correlation between earthquake events and volcanic eruption in a specific date and region
to investigate the activity earth crust.
IMPLEMENTATION: When outputting data related to volcanic eruption in a specific region, also output corresponding earthquakes events information
in adjacent areas using either country location or longitude and latitude to locate.

Implementation/Web-Development discussion:
Outputting the raw data seems boring, but associating a map to our natural events seems to be to challenging to accomplish with the time frame we
are in. However, we do have longitude and latitude information that we need for implementing an interactive map, which might be the core design 
of our website and help us align other relevant information together smoothly. There has to be some interesting development ideas that lead the
users to investigate the data more and involve them visually.
