#Mansion of Munglis#
By Lily Li and Kevin Phung

The Mansion of Munglis is an escape/survival game.
The player character's movement is controlled by arrow keys (left, right, up)
and shooting is initiated via space bar.

Landing on a moving series of platform, in order to win the game, the player needs to:
1: Not fall down from the platforms
2: Not touch the Munglis
3: Shoot down 100 Munglis within certain amount of time, before the platform ends
(approximately 1 minute)

The game currently contains 2 modes of different themes:
Ancient & Classic
The player is able to select the desired mode at the beginning of the game.
